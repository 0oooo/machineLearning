Coursework 2 of the AI module in Middlesex University.
The goal of the coursework is to categorise one of handwritten digits. Two datasets come from the University of California at Irvine's Machine Learning Repository (Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set). 
 
The first step is to use euclidean distance to find the closest bitmap in the data set 1 for each bitmap in the data set 2. 
The efficiency of this method is calculated and displayed. 

The second step is to create a multilayer perceptron.
